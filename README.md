# SelfDriving-Car-ObjDetection
Self-Driving Car Object Detection
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for an object detection system tailored for self-driving cars. The system is designed to identify and track objects in real-time, enabling autonomous vehicles to make informed decisions and navigate safely.

Features
Object detection using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
Real-time processing for quick decision-making.
Pre-trained models for common object categories.
Customizable for specific project requirements.
Evaluation tools for model performance assessment.
Usage
Modify the configuration files to adjust detection parameters and specify input sources.
Run the system on your self-driving car's hardware platform.
Monitor object detection results and make use of the identified objects for navigation and decision-making.
Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this project by opening issues, submitting pull requests, or providing feedback. We welcome collaboration to improve and expand the capabilities of the self-driving car object detection system.
Acknowledgments
We'd like to express our gratitude to the open-source community and the developers of the deep learning frameworks and pre-trained models that made this project possible.
